The lack of consensus in evaluating continual learning algorithms and the almost exclusive focus on forgetting motivate us to propose a more comprehensive set of implementation independent metrics accounting for several factors we believe have practical implications worth considering in the deployment of real AI systems that learn continually: accuracy or performance over time, backward and forward knowledge transfer, memory overhead as well as computational efficiency. Drawing inspiration from the standard Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT) we further propose to fuse these metrics into a single score for ranking purposes and we evaluate our proposal with five continual learning strategies on the iCIFAR-100 continual learning benchmark.","tags":["continual-learning","deep-learning"],"title":"Don't forget, there is more than forgetting: new metrics for Continual Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hanna Pirinen","Lotta Kauhanen","Riitta Danielsson-Ojala","Johan Lilius","Ilona Tuominen","Natalia Díaz Rodríguez","Sanna Salanterä"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"c831f46ccbf4253246ef08b7510181ef","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/pirinen2015registered/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pirinen2015registered/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Registered Nurses’ Experiences with the Medication Administration Process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia A Díaz Rodríguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"904a010dea7bf7692a5e1082bc3e57f2","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/diaz2015semantic/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/diaz2015semantic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Semantic and fuzzy modelling for human behaviour recognition in smart spaces: a case study on ambient assisted living.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nauman Ahmed Khan","Natalia Díaz Rodríguez","Riitta Danielsson-Ojala","Hanna Pirinen","Lotta Kauhanen","Sanna Salanterä","Joachim Majors","Sebu Björklund","Kimmo Rautanen","Tapio Salakoski"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"edd760e9403ab07fefdde8742a37e5f3","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/khan2015smart/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/khan2015smart/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Smart Dosing: A mobile application for tracking the medication tray-filling and dispensation processes in hospital wards.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Díaz Rodríguez","Manuel P Cuéllar","Johan Lilius","Miguel Delgado Calvo-Flores"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"8063b868104bdf67f80c92d42a09317e","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/rodriguez2014fuzzy/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguez2014fuzzy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A fuzzy ontology for semantic modelling and recognition of human behaviour","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Díaz Rodríguez","MP Cuéllar","Johan Lilius","Miguel Delgado Calvo-Flores"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"79439742e4a59d9dc9765afcb900f99e","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/rodriguez2014survey/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguez2014survey/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A survey on ontologies for human behavior recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Natalia Díaz Rodríguez","Johan Lilius","Sebu Björklund","Joachim Majors","Kimmo Rautanen","Riitta Danielsson-Ojala","Hanna Pirinen","Lotta Kauhanen","Sanna Salanterä","Tapio Salakoski"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"92ab28540a110703a3c7ba2f24ad6970","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/rodriguez2014can/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rodriguez2014can/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Can IT health-care applications improve the medication tray-filling process at hospital wards?

Approaches used for this objective are auto-encoders, learning forward models, inverse dynamics or learning using generic priors on the state characteristics. However, the diversity in applications and methods makes the field lack standard evaluation datasets, metrics and tasks. This paper provides a set of environments, data generators, robotic control tasks, metrics and tools to facilitate iterative state representation learning and evaluation in reinforcement learning settings.","tags":["DREAM-Project","deep-learning"],"title":"S-RL Toolbox: Environments, Datasets and Evaluation Metrics for State Representation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timothée Lesort","Natalia Díaz-Rodríguez","Jean-François Goudou","David Filliat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541351983,"objectID":"656402f6e18f6c5db39584507d0fe61e","permalink":"https://nataliadiaz.github.io/publication/srl/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/srl/","section":"publication","summary":"Representation learning algorithms are designed to learn abstract features that characterize data. State representation learning (SRL) focuses on a particular kind of representation learning where learned features are in low dimension, evolve through time, and are influenced by actions of an agent. The representation is learned to capture the variation in the environment generated by the agent's actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable for robotics and control scenarios. In particular, the low dimension characteristic of the representation helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, provides easier interpretation and utilization by humans and can help improve performance and speed in policy learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning. This survey aims at covering the state-of-the-art on state representation learning in the most recent years. It reviews different SRL methods that involve interaction with the environment, their implementations and their applications in robotics control tasks (simulated or real). In particular, it highlights how generic learning objectives are differently exploited in the reviewed algorithms. Finally, it discusses evaluation methods to assess the representation learned and summarizes current and future lines of research.","tags":["DREAM-Project","deep-learning"],"title":"State
